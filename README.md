# Task_1
Though i have made this to perform basic vulnerability checks for sql injection and cross-site scripting(XSS) on any target website to check using python and fastapi.
For checking part i have used  - ( https://www.voltsec-io.com/ ) website and checked for any sql vulnerability . As a result i found none .

For endpoints , there is - ( /scan/sql-injection/ ).
I have used python request library to handle GET request and print the result as json format.

In this i have checked my website for a single payload i.e.; SQL injection .
NOW i have to do with 
--> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads:
--> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Payloads:
--> Command Injection Payloads:
--> Directory Traversal Payloads:
--> XML External Entity (XXE) Payloads:
--> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) Payloads:
--> Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Payloads:
--> XPath Injection Payloads:
--> LDAP Injection Payloads:

Based upon the target system and specific vulnerability , they can be modified .
